# Multiplication-Dojo

Multiplication Dojo can be used to help you practice your multiplication tables! This skill allows users to choose which multiplication table they want to practice, and then randomly generates ten multiplication questions using the specified number. Immediate feedback is one of the keys to effective learning, and in this app, each response is met with either a "Correct!", or an "Incorrect," as well as what the correct answer should have been. At the end of the ten questions, the user is given a final score of how many questions they answered correctly.
